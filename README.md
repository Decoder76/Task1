# Transaction Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing transaction data from a financial institution. It involves processing a CSV file containing transaction information and generating insights through data visualization and analysis.

## Overview

The transaction dataset consists of various attributes such as transaction type, amount, account balances, and fraud detection indicators. The project aims to provide visualizations and analyses to better understand the transaction patterns and detect potential fraud activities.

## Features

- Visualizations of transaction types
- Analysis of transaction types split by fraud
- Scatter plot of origin account balance delta vs. destination account balance delta for Cash Out transactions

## File Structure

- `transactions.csv`: The dataset containing transaction information
- `<your-notebook_name>.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data analysis and visualization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/<repo-name>.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `<your-notebook_name>.ipynb` to analyze the transaction data.

## Usage

- Load the dataset `transactions.csv` into your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python script).
- Run the code to perform data analysis and generate visualizations.
- Explore the insights provided by the visualizations and analyses to understand transaction patterns and detect fraud activities.
